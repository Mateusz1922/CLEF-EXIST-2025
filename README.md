The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate transformer-based models to automatically detect
and categorize sexist content in social media posts, as part of the EXIST 2025 challenge.

I addressed these tasks using English and Spanish datasets and evaluated performance using
standard classification metrics and the ICM score.

The jupyter notebooks contain code implemented in Python programming language necessary to perform sexism 
classification on EXIST Tweets Dataset. 

The file Sexism-Detection-in-Social-Media-Using.pdf Transformers contain presentation that includes all the results 
of the classification and their comparison between different approaches used to perform the experiments.

Files Report_LNR.pdf and Krol-Mateusz-Guey_Pinguino.pdf contain final report on the purpose, methodology and overview of 
all approaches undertaken to conduct the classification task.
